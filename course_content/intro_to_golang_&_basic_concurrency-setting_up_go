1. Which command initializes a new Go module in your current directory?
   
   A) `go init module`
   - Incorrect. Remember that the command structure uses 'mod' instead of 'module' and 'init' is not the first keyword.
  
   B) `go mod init`
   - Correct. `go mod init` initializes a new Go module in your current directory. It creates a `go.mod` file that describes the module.
   
   C) `go module start`
   - Incorrect. 'go module start' is not a valid command in Go. Revisit the commands used to create a module in Go.

2. What is the default file created when you initialize a new Go module and what does it contain?
   
   A) `go.mod`, which contains the module path and its dependencies.
   - Correct. Initializing a Go module creates a `go.mod` file, listing the module path and its dependencies.
   
   B) `go.pack`, which contains all the Go packages in the module
   - Incorrect. Go does not generate a `go.pack` file upon module initialization. The main file of each module has a specific name.
   
   C) `mod.go`, which contains the main function
   - Incorrect. `mod.go` is not the file created during module initialization. Go uses a specific file to maintain the module details.

3. Looking at the following code, what does `go.mod` file do in this context?

```go
module github.com/my/repo

go 1.14

require (
    github.com/pkg/errors v0.8.1
    golang.org/x/net v0.0.0-20200202094626-16171245cfb2
)
```

   A) It specifies the version of Go used in the project
   - Incorrect. Although `go.mod` specifies the language version "go 1.14", it serves a broader purpose in a module.
   
   B) It defines the module path, the project's dependencies, and the Go version
   - Correct. The `go.mod` file defines the module path, the Go version, and all the dependencies required by the project.
   
   C) It is the main script that runs the module
   - Incorrect. `go.mod` does not contain any runnable code. Try to remember its actual purpose.

4. What is the difference between packages and modules in Go?
   
   A) Modules are older; packages were introduced in Go 1.13
   - Incorrect. Both packages and modules have been part of Go since its earlier versions, but they serve different purposes.
   
   B) A module is a collection of Go packages, while a package is a way to organize code within a module
   - Correct. Modules can contain multiple packages, and each of the packages can contain multiple Go source files.
   
   C) There is no difference, the terms are interchangeable
   - Incorrect. Although dependencies can be a mix of packages and modules, these are distinct concepts in Go.

7. What happens when you execute `go mod tidy` in a module with unused dependencies?
   
   A) It deletes all unused Go files in the module
   - Incorrect. `go mod tidy` does not delete any Go source files. It affects a different component in a module.
   
   B) It adds missing dependencies and removes unnecessary ones
   - Correct. `go mod tidy` ensures that the go.mod file matches the source code in the module by adding required and removing unused dependencies to the go.mod file.
   
   C) It compiles all Go source files in the module
   - Incorrect. `go mod tidy` is not involved in the compilation process. It helps manage module dependencies.

10. How can you ensure that your Go module is using the latest version of its dependencies?
   
   A) By manually editing the version numbers in the `go.mod` file
   - Incorrect. Manually editing the version numbers in `go.mod` is not a recommended practice in Go programming as there's an in-built methodology for it.
   
   B) By executing `go get -u`
   - Correct. `go get -u` updates all the direct and indirect dependencies to the latest version.
   
   C) Versions are automatically updated each time the module is run
   - Incorrect. The Go module does not update dependency versions each time it is run. Explicit command is required to update dependencies.

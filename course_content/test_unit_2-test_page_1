1. Let's say you're teaching a colleague how to set up Go on their machine, and they ask you about a command to check if Go is installed properly. What would you suggest?

    A) Telling them to use `check go`
    - Incorrect. There is no such command as `check go`. The correct command actually involves using Go's name itself.
  
    B) Advising them to run `go --version`
    - Incorrect. While this command syntax might work with other languages/tools, Go uses a different convention.

    C) Telling them to run `go version`
    - Correct. Running `go version` will display the installed version of Go, or inform them that Go is not found if it's not installed correctly.


2. Imagine you're starting a Go project and need to manage various packages your project depends on. What feature of Go would assist you with this?
   
    A) Turning on fast execution mode to make Golang applications run faster
    - Incorrect. Go Modules are not responsible for enhancing the performance of applications. They serve a different purpose in the ecosystem.

    B) Making use of Go Modules for dependency management
    - Correct. Indeed, Go Modules allow you to handle dependencies more efficiently in your projects.

    C) Implementing Go routines to parallelize the code
    - Incorrect. Even though Go is indeed capable of handling the mentioned parallel and concurrent operations, this concept is unrelated to Go Modules.

3. Here's a scenario - you're in the directory of your Go project on your terminal. What command would initiate a new module?

    A) `go new module`
    - Incorrect. This command would not initialize Go modules.
  
    B) `go mod start`
    - Incorrect. While intuitive, this command does conform with the Go language syntax for initializing a module.

    C) `go mod init`
    - Correct. Indeed, `go mod init` is used to start a new Go module.

4. Given this Go code on your mod file named `go.mod` 

```go
module example

go 1.15

require github.com/pkg/errors v0.9.1 // indirect
```
 Now, let's say you run `go mod tidy` and that you're not using the `github.com/pkg/errors` package anymore within your project. What would you expect the `go mod tidy` command to do?

    A) Compile and run the Go code
    - Incorrect. The `go mod tidy` functionality does not include compiling or executing code.

    B) Update the `go.mod` file to its current usage in the project
    - Correct. `go mod tidy` ensures that the go.mod file matches the current usage in the project, which includes removing the unused packages.

    C) Print the Go version on the terminal
    - Incorrect. The `go mod tidy` command does not interact with Go version information.

5. While initiating a Go module with the command `go mod init example.com/my/project` you accidentally made a typo in the module path. What would the Go toolchain do?

    A) Create new directories to match your typo
    - Incorrect. It doesn't create any new directories based on what you input as your module path.

    B) It's not possible to finalize module initiation
    - Correct. The initiation process would indeed fail as it can't validate the path due to the typo.

    C) Overlook the typo and create a module at default path
    - Incorrect. The Go toolchain doesn't do this either- it strictly follows the provided module path.
